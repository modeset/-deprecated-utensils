# Todo

## WIP
- Behavior classes should dispatch events
- Listing of needed utensils
  - Carousel indicators, status, etc
  - Background section (something that scales)
  - Fishnet
  - Stateful button
- Media queries
- Mobilize (templates, styles, js, etc..)
- Test dinosaurs css and js
- Complete Todo items

## Reminders, Tasks and Future Considerations
- There should be some sort of Toggle class that acts similar to the
  demo (removes a bunch of classes then add more) pass a data-remove?
- Should events have more of a namespace to avoid collisions?
- Need to figure out a way for the Directional tests to be more stable
  when there are other failures

## Repository
- FPO images (can't go public with the Burton photos)
- Turn into engine
- Add generators
- Better tools for documentation (generation, behavior, and styles)
- Better docs
- Use the style guide for dinosaur test
- Jasmine rice loading fixtures from app instead of
  /spec/javascripts/fixtures
